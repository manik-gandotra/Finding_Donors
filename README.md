# Finding_Donors
Part of the Udacity Machine Learning Course:
In this project a model has been created to predict whether a person will donate money for a charity by predicting his/her income based on the features of the data available.
Three supervised learning methods: K-NN, SVM, Decision Trees have been used and the algorithm which is best for the data is finally used.
Decision trees are used for the final model as they provide the best accuracy and f-beta score. The parameters of the decision trees have also been modified to avoid over fitting of data.
